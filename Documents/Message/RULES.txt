Rules:
Each card is unique and has both a type and a value between 1 and 9.
The 4 card types are:
- 🔪 : Knife
- 🔫 : Gun
- 👊 : Fist
- 🧪 : Acid
Each player has a hand of 5 cards drawn from a deck of 36 cards.
Each turn, a player has 30 seconds to play one card (otherwise, a random card is automatically played).

Win Conditions:
There are three possible victory types per round:
1. Aggressive Victory:
    The player with the superior type wins.
    → Winner: +2 pts | Loser: +0 pts

    Type hierarchy:
    - Acid beats Gun
    - Gun beats Knife
    - Knife beats Fist
    - Fist beats Acid
2. Equal-Type Victory:
    If both cards share the same type, the higher value wins.
    → Winner: +1 pt | Loser: +0 pt
3. Opposite Victory:
    If the types differ but are not in an aggressive relationship, the lower value wins.
    → Winner: +0 pt | Loser: -1 pt
    If both values are equal → no points are awarded.

End of the Game:
At the end of each round, 5 new cards are dealt to both players.
A match ends when:
- a player reaches 7 points, or
- after 13 rounds (in which case both players lose).
